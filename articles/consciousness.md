# How to achieve class consciousness

1. Recognize that society is divided into classes and know the thing that separates them. In capitalism, this thing is the private ownership over the means of production. Those who own it are the burgeoise and those who do not, the proletariat. There are other ways of classifying people, but nothing as meaningful. The division into lower, middle and upper classes is based on arbitary wealth brackets and tells little of a persons role in society.

2. Realize that the two classes have different material interests that are in complete opposition to one another. A policy that helps one, usually hurts the other. Thus, they cannot and do not work together on material questions. Any exception is deceit.

3. Identify the class that contains you. Identify your material interests, and work towards bettering your material condition.

4. Embrace class solidarity. Identify those who share your material interests not as competition, but as comrades, and those with opposing interets as your opponents. Do not adopt fake enemies that are sent to distract you. Work together as a unified class to better the condition of all. Do not try to escape your plight alone by exploiting your comrades, as this makes you a class traitor.

5. Learn the history of class struggle, for all of history is in fact that of class struggle. See how class is born out of a conflict of material interests, and therefore class struggle does not end until class distinction disappears, which happens only after the disappearance of the conflict that defines it. This conflict, to repeat, is the private ownership over the means of production. Class struggle ends only after they are owned by all, or by none at all.
