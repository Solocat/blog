# Centrist Taxonomy

"What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?" - Captain Zapp Brannigan

Centrism can be difficult to define. Where is the political center? Is it absolute, unmoving through history, or relative to the current political climate? If the latter, is it the median, the mean, of some other point in the political spectrum? Do we consider the center in relation to the political spectrum of the globe, the nation or some other demography? If we assume that all people are randomly scattered along the political axis or axes, then it is infinitely unlikely for a person to be exactly at the center. For centrists to exist, then, there must be an arbitarily large area in the spectrum that encompasses centrism.

Along the possible political axis there are bounds set by society. The political values and rhetoric that occurs within these bounds are considered more or less acceptable and can be found in public debate, though perhaps not in mass media. These bounds form the frames of the Overton window. The window is different from demographic to another, and over time might shift left or right, and contract or expand. Perhaps it is in the middle of this window where we will find the political center.

The idea of what centrism is seems to vary from person to person. In this paper, we will not try to define an objective center. Instead, we will categorize the different types of centrist-identifying-persons.

1. The accidental centrist

The first type of centrist is one who holds a certain set of relatively stable political values. These values happen to put the person in the middle of the Overton window, or what people generally consider to be the center. This is the only kind of centrist which might not be aware of their centrism, but sometimes they correctly identify themselves as one. Over time, a shift of the political climate may appear to throw this person off center. In truth of course, they stay put and the world moves around them. They are, therefore, not forever centrists, only in relation to the current status quo. Like other centrists, they enjoy the privilege of being in the center, and so will generally try to stop the status quo from shifting. Neither progressive nor reactionary, they stay stubbornly still, trying to stop the world from moving away.

2. The center chaser

This is largely the opposite of the first type. They identify themselves stronly as centrist. In political turmoil, they move where the world moves, always sticking to the center. This is because they have no real principles, but simply believe in ideas such as the golden mean and horseshoe theory. They think there is objectivity, wisdom, lack of bias and in general, superiority in centrism, regardless of where the center is situated and what it stands for. They are centrists for centrism's sake, and smugly look down on others who cannot see both sides of every argument. As the political axis tilts, they will still generally try to keep things as they are, but as a person without organic principles, they will reluctantly slide along the axis to where it takes them, adopting new values so they can keep calling themselves centrists.

These people can be further divided into two subtypes:

2A. The apathetic apolitician

The cool guy who doesn't care. Uninterested in politics, and of the opinion that it is ruining culture, the apathetic centrist would rather just enjoy their privileged, comfortable life without all the yelling. Has the super powers to see politics anywhere. More easily malleable by changes in political climate. They get their sense of superiority from their immunity to apparent bias and the lies of media.

2B. The radical centrist

The more strongly political variety, not cynical but open to ideas regardless of their merit. The radical centrist believes that all people must be listened to, seeing themselves as the mediator between the lowly left and right. Seeing both sides as hard-working producers of ideas, giving themselves, the brains of the operation, the noble task of sifting through the muck, finding the perfect compromise among all the noise. Has the super power of seeing neutrality anywhere. Gets their sense of superiority from their out-of-the-box, galactical thinking.

3. A product of their time

Similar to the first type, yet even more stubborn. Rarely changes opinion and not only prevents the world from changing, is trying to put it back to the time they were the center. The product of their time does not, indeed, stay centrist for long, but grows the bitterer, the further right they are forced by progress. But their most interesting aspect is the fact that their values are not adopted through a process of meditation, but have simply absorbed their surrounding politics, inherited the teachings of their elders, and crystallized it all into the pure essence of status quo. This image of their youth they hold in their heart till their breath stills.

4. Just... not a centrist

Then we have those who are quick to announce their centrism, even though an analysis of their actual political positions would require, at the very least, a broad definition of the political center. Curiously, these people are usually found to be right-leaning by outside observers. The nature of their dubious self-identification varies, and creates three sub-classes:

4A. Honestly ignorant

Perhaps they simply think they are more-or-less centrist, because they have limited exposure to reality. Either actively avoiding politics, or living in a bubble of like-minded people, they see slight variations of opinion and identify them as the extent of political debate. These kind of people usually live a cozy, coddled life, similar to type 3, but with the difference that they were never a centrist. They have absorbed the values of a much smaller, notably biased, community, while being blind to that bias and to the values of larger society. Near-sighted is perhaps a better word, seeing only a part of the big picture.

4B. Dishonest to oneself

This is similar to type 2, in that they like to see themselves as superior. They follow the logic of confirmation bias: Centrism is unbiased. Unbiased is smart. I am smart. Therefore I must be unbiased. Therefore I must be centrist. But unlike type 2, they actually have values they hold dear, and are unwilling to change position. They are often egotismic, seeing themselves in the center, in the spotlight, and interpret the political bias of others in relation to themselves.

4C. Tactically dishonest

Mostly right leaning, sometimes extremely so. The tactician is mostly aware of their actual positions, but because they fall too far from the center, the moderate, and even outside the Overton window, they choose to appear milder in public. Perhaps they are ashamed of their views, feel discriminated against, or simply want to please others and gather the greatest approval. Understandably, this is a common type for a politician. This deception might be motivated by self-preservation, selfish gain or a delibirate attempt at poisoning the discourse and artificially shifting the Overton window to their side.

Out of all members of the centrist family, it is the type 1, a member only by chance and not always willingly, that is the noblest. That is, if we consider their values to be noble. Which is the case as long as we consider the status quo, and the desire to hold on to it, noble. All other types suffer from weakness of principle, unawareness or dishonesty. The accidental centrist can only be judged by the content of their values.
